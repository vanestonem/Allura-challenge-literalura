# Project Title

LiterAlura - Java Project


## Overview



The LiterAlura project is a console application developed using Spring Boot that interacts with the Gutendex.com API to access a vast collection of book information. This application allows users to fetch books from the API and store them in a database for later retrieval. Users can also query their saved books based on title, genre, language, and authors. Additionally, the application supports operations to retrieve authors who were alive after a specified date entered by the user.

Special thanks to Gutendex.com for providing the valuable book data and to the Spring Boot community for the robust framework.
